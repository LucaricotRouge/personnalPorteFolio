            </h1>
            <p>
                This project is a rhythm game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game lets players create a character by choosing 
                a male or female character and entering his or her name. You can then select one of the characters created in the player section 
                and press start to launch the game. During the game, the program allows you to save your score and accuracy in an Excel file at 
                the end of each game. Game statistics are graphically displayed using Jupyter Notebook, and the player also has access to a 
                leaderboard in the character selection menu to view the current ranking (it resets when the program is closed, but is maintained 
                as long as it is open, even if several games are run). For ease of use, misses are not counted when pigs leave the screen, but 
                only when the player presses space at the wrong time as the pig approaches the character's hitbox. The intuition for a perfect 
                score is as follows: press space when the pig's nose is above the character's yellow ball. The pause menu appears when you press 
                the “P” key on the keyboard. The player has a total of 3 lives before beeing turned into a pig by the evil pig curse...
