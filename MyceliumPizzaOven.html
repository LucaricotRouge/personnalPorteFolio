            <h1>
                Pizza Oven Made Of Mycelium
            </h1>
            
            <p>
                As part of my innovation project in my first year of my Masters, I decided to do a resilient future project. 
                My aim is to make a pizza oven entirely out of mycelium composite in an extreme temperature environment of around 300Â°C. 
                The choice of mycelium was made mainly for its advantages of lightness and thermal insulation. However, as a bio-material, 
                exposure to high temperatures can lead to deformation of its structure and fire resistance. This is why I have used two protocols 
                that I will combine to reinforce the fire resistance and thermal stability of the mycelium composite in the inner layer of the 
                oven that will be directly exposed to the heat source. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14806-6">
                The first protocol</a> enables fireproof mycelium to be grown directly by integrating silicon directly into the internal structure 
                of the fungal fibres as they grow. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391023001714?casa_token=
                jH15BQBFrYMAAAAA:OSSES2ZWdQqA9ojSkBoWsrm8gg_qf4eNIkrwz21Cn_ULL5Y4Ah5TZdZp2f1bvkyR43Det2koSCXc">The second protocol</a> 
                uses glass microspheres and a deacetylation process to enhance the thermal stability and fire resistance of the mycelium. 
                The oven will have a spherical shape and the design will be inspired by the HyphaL mycelium enclosure, winner of the 2024 green 
                concept award:

                Prototype

                <p>
                    To build this oven I took advantage of the living nature of mycelium, which allowed the oven to grow directly in a plaster mould. 
                    This first layer will form the outer structure of the oven. The inner layer will be made of a composite of reinforced and fireproof mycelium 
                    thanks to the application of the two protocols mentioned above. Before designing the final version of the oven, we created a first prototype 
                    in mycelium (without chemical modification) of medium size compared to the final version to study the behaviour of the mycelium available in 
                    our laboratory against fire. I then made a plaster mould in which I grew the mycelium into a half-sphere shape. At the same time, I made another 
                    cube-shaped prototype, this time with a PLA mould, to study the influence of geometry on the mycelium's resistance to fire.
