            <p>
                For this project, we were asked to model an aircraft of our choice on Solidworks. Along with 4 other people, I modeled the 
                Concorde, a hypersonic aircraft. I was in charge of modeling the fuselage. The other parts of the plane modeled by the other 
                members of the group were then assembled to form the complete aircraft.             
            </p>

                <p>
                    I used several plans of the Concorde fuselage on which I based the design of the fuselage. A profile plan and a rear plan 
                    allowed me to design this part of the Concorde to the scale set by the group and to make assembly possible with the remaining 
                    parts of the Concorde, in particular the body on which the fuselage was to be assembled and fixed.

                    The parts modelled by my fellow students, such as engines, wheels, wings and body, were assembled in a single assembly file. 
                    Here's a short video demonstrating our model after assembly:
